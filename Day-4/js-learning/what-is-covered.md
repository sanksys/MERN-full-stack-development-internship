---

## 6️⃣ Arrays & Objects

You will learn:
- How to work with arrays and objects
- Spread operator (`...`)

📌 **Outcome:**  
You’ll be ready to work with React state safely and correctly.

---

## 7️⃣ DOM Manipulation (Understanding the Old Way)

You will learn:
- What the DOM is
- How JavaScript updates HTML manually
- Why manual DOM manipulation becomes complex

📌 **Outcome:**  
You’ll understand **why React exists** and what problem it solves.

---

## 8️⃣ Events & User Interaction

You will learn:
- JavaScript events (click, load, input, etc.)
- Event listeners
- How user actions trigger logic

📌 **Outcome:**  
You’ll be ready to handle user interactions in React (`onClick`, `onChange`).

---

## 9️⃣ Asynchronous JavaScript (Very Important)

You will learn:
- Synchronous vs asynchronous execution
- Promises
- `async / await`
- Basic API calling mindset

📌 **Outcome:**  
You’ll be comfortable working with APIs — a core part of MERN applications.
